Features
Design Precision: The application faithfully replicates the Figma design, ensuring a seamless user experience.
Responsive Interface: Hoobank is optimized for all devices, providing a consistent experience whether on desktop or mobile.
Component-Based Structure: Utilizing React, the application is modular, making it easy to extend and maintain.
Utility-First Styling: Tailwind CSS allows for efficient and consistent styling throughout the application.
Technologies Used
React: For building dynamic user interfaces.
HTML5: For structuring the web pages.
Tailwind CSS: For styling the application with utility-first classes.
Figma: The design platform used to create the original layout.
Usage
After starting the development server, you can access Hoobank in your web browser. The application allows users to explore various banking features as designed in the original Figma file.

Customization

Styling: Tailwind CSS is used for styling. You can customize styles directly in the JSX files or update the Tailwind configuration to reflect design changes.
